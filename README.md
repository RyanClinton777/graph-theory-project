# Graph Theory Project - REGEX Search
## Description
This is my submission for the **Graph Theory** Module in Semester 2 of year 3 in **Computing in Software Development BSc**.

It is a console-based program written in Python 3, which allows the user to search for certain patterns/character sequences in a text file, using **Regular Expressions (REGEX)**.

The user inputs a text file (path), and a REGEX search pattern, and the program will print lines from the file where the matches are found.
